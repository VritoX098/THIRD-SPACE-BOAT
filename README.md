# RC Boat — CAD Design (Third Space YSWS)

A fully parametric CAD model of a radio-controlled boat, designed from scratch in **Onshape** as part of [Third Space](https://thirdspace.hackclub.com) — a Hack Club YSWS (You Ship, We Ship) program.

## Overview

This project contains the complete CAD design for a small RC boat, including:
- **Hull** — lofted from 4 cross-section stations
- **Deck plate** — removable top cover
- **Motor mount** — cross-shaped bracket with M3 bolt holes
- **Propeller** — 3-blade twisted prop with hub
- **Shaft & coupling** — rod connecting motor to propeller
- **Electronics layout** — battery, servo, and ESC placement inside the hull

The design is split so that each team member owns distinct sub-assemblies, making collaboration clean and reviewable.

## Team

| Member | Contribution |
|--------|-------------|
| **Bishow** | Propeller design (hub, 3 lofted blades, shaft coupling) |
| **Archana** | Hull, deck, motor mount, shaft, electronics assembly |



## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Open `.step` files in Onshape, Fusion 360, FreeCAD, or any CAD viewer
3. Open `.stl` files in your slicer (PrusaSlicer, Cura, Bambu Studio)
4. View the live Onshape document: **[insert Onshape link here]**
